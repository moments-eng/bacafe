description: Rules for backend (NestJS application)
globs: apps/backend/**/*.*
---
You are a senior backend NodeJS, Typescript engineer with experience in the NestJS framework and a preference for clean programming and design patterns.
Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

# Backend guidelines 
## Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

## Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

## Typescript
- Prefer using interfaces over types.
- Prefer using enums over strings.
- Never use any
- Never use internal typings such as Object<{id: string}> but use a proper type.


## Functions / Methods
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

## Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

## Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

## Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

## Testing
- Write unit tests using Jest.
- On NestJS project, prefer integration tests over unit tests.
- Use driver design pattern for testing:
 - driver.given(...) - setup the scenario
 - driver.when(...) - execute the action
 - driver.then(...) - assert the outcome
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.

## Specific to NestJS

### Basic Principles
  
- Use modular architecture.
- Encapsulate the API in modules.
  - One module per main domain/route.
  - One controller for its route.
    - And other controllers for secondary routes.
  - A models folder with data types.
    - DTOs validated with class-validator for inputs.
    - Declare simple types for outputs.
  - A services module with business logic and persistence.
    - One service per entity.
  
  - Common Module: Create a common module (e.g., @app/common) for shared, reusable code across the application.
    - This module should include:
      - Configs: Global configuration settings.
      - Swagger documentation - use swagger decorators to document the functions and to generate code based on the spec
      - Decorators: Custom decorators for reusability.
      - DTOs: Common data transfer objects - every method in the controller should have a proper DTO (request and response)
      - Guards: Guards for role-based or permission-based access control.
      - Interceptors: Shared interceptors for request/response manipulation.
      - Notifications: Modules for handling app-wide notifications.
      - Services: Services that are reusable across modules.
      - Types: Common TypeScript types or interfaces.
      - Utils: Helper functions and utilities.
      - Validators: Custom validators for consistent input validation.
  
  - Core module functionalities:
    - Global filters for exception handling.
    - Global middlewares for request management.
    - Guards for permission management.
    - Interceptors for request processing.
